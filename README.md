Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##Introduction

This repository contains my work for cleaning and tidying the UCI Machine Learning Repository Human Activity Using Smartphones data set.   The work was completed as part of the course project required for Getting and Cleaning Data.

##About the script run_analysis.R

The run_analysis.R script is the complete R script used to edit and clean the UCI Dataset.  This script will load the original data, clean up variable names, reduce the data set to only the mean and standard deviation of observations as well as export a tidy dataset.

##Tidymeans.txt

The tidy means text file is an output from the R script that provides an average for each variable, each activity for each subject from the dataset.

##About the code book

Please see the codebook within the repository for additional information that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations completed to clean up the data set
